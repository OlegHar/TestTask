Demowebshop Performance Test Plan

1. Test Scope:
   We will focus on the **purchase process** (browse products → add to cart → checkout → payment) since it is a critical business flow and stresses the server more than just browsing.

2. Test Approach:

* **Test Type:** Load Test
* **Objective:** Measure website performance under high user load and identify bottlenecks in the purchase flow.
* **Test Scenario Steps:**

  1. Open homepage
  2. Navigate to a product category (e.g., Books or Electronics)
  3. Select a product
  4. Add product to cart
  5. Go to cart and proceed to checkout
  6. Enter fake delivery and payment details
  7. Confirm the order
* **JMeter Approach:** Use JMeter's **recording functionality** to capture the manually performed scenario and generate an automated test script.

3. Test Parameters:

* **Number of Users (Threads):** 50–200
* **Ramp-Up Period:** 1–5 minutes
* **Loop Count:** 2–5 iterations per user
* **Timers:** Random timer of 1–3 seconds between requests to simulate real behavior
* **Assertions:**

  * HTTP Response Code = 200
  * Confirmation message appears on order page

4. Metrics to Collect:

* Response Time (average, min, max)
* Throughput (requests per second)
* Error Rate
* Server CPU/Memory usage (if monitoring available)

5. JMeter Test Plan Structure (textual representation):

* Test Plan

  * Thread Group (Users, Ramp-Up, Loop Count)

    * HTTP Request Defaults (base URL: [https://demowebshop.tricentis.com](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com))
    * HTTP Requests for each step in the scenario
    * Timers (Random Timer)
    * Assertions (Response code, text check)
    * Listeners (View Results in Table, Aggregate Report)
